# Security_Plus_Notes_2
Hello! Today, I had the opportunity to get down some notes and progress through my Security+ studies! Still having a great time with being able to learn how to have a proper security posture on different levels within an organization to help keep attackers guessing. 

Topics that will be included in these notes:
- Physical Security
- Fencing and Bollards
- Attacking with Brute Force
- Surveillance Systems
- Bypassing Surveillance Systems
- Access Control Vestibules
- Door Locks
- Access Badge Cloning

In all honesty, what initially peaked my interests to venture down the cybersecurity rabbit hole was not the physical aspect of security. My focus was centralized on configuring firewalls, deploying honeypots, and conducting digital forensics. Those seemed like all of the cool things that you hear and see on movies and shows. No one ever seemed to talk much about how well a fence does it's job or whether a lock is electronic or mechanical. However, I must admit that the aspect of physical security should not be overlooked. Guards, gates, and vestibules can actually be considered the first line of defense when securing an organization and it's network against an adversary. There also may even be a chance that with the appropriate posture, a penetration tester or threat actor could be deterred for good. Do not underestimate the value and potency of these factors of security and keep trying to figure out new ways to stop exploitations from occuring.
